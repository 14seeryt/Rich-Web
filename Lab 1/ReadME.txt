Question 3 - My Extension is made to inform the user that the webpage they are attempting to access is 
             unavailable to minorly inconvenience them throughout their use of their browser. It replaces all images on 
             screen with an array of 5 selected error message images. It achievs this by storing the images as links in an array.
             This array is then reversed through and a random image is picked and then replaces an image on the visted webpage.
             Each header element is replaced by text that tells the user errors are awesome as well paragraphs being replaced with another error message.
             Finally a .alert() message appears if there is an input box present informing the user that the webpage no longer works.
