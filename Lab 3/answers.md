1. Stream abstraction is when reading or writing files or communicating over a network socket. A Stream is simply a Collection that arrives over time. Observables are like collectionsâ€¦ except they arrive over time asynchronously. Stream can only be used once, Observable can be subscribed to many times. A stream is a reusable piece of code that abstracts the complexity of dealing with data while providing useful operations to perform on data an example would be a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.
